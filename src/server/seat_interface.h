 * adjust the user interface accordingly. For example, scroll events
 * from a "finger" source may be in a smooth coordinate space with
 * kinetic scrolling whereas a "wheel" source may be in discrete steps
 * of a number of lines.
 *
 * The "continuous" axis source is a device generating events in a
 * continuous coordinate space, but using something other than a
 * finger. One example for this source is button-based scrolling where
 * the vertical motion of a device is converted to scroll events while
 * a button is held down.
 *
 * The "wheel tilt" axis source indicates that the actual device is a
 * wheel but the scroll event is not caused by a rotation but a
 * (usually sideways) tilt of the wheel.

/**
 * @brief Represents a Seat on the Wayland Display.
 *
 * A Seat is a set of input devices (e.g. Keyboard, Pointer and Touch) the client can connect
 * to. The server needs to announce which input devices are supported and passes dedicated input
 * focus to a SurfaceInterface. Only the focused surface receives input events.
 *
 * The SeatInterface internally handles enter and release events when setting a focused surface.
 * Also it handles input translation from global to the local coordination, removing the need from
 * the user of the API to track the focused surfaces and can just interact with this class.
 *
 * To create a SeatInterface use @link Display::createSeat @endlink. Then one can set up what is
 * supported. Last but not least create needs to be called.
 *
 * @code
 * SeatInterface *seat = display->createSeat();
 * // set up
 * seat->setName(QStringLiteral("seat0"));
 * seat->setHasPointer(true);
 * seat->setHasKeyboard(true);
 * seat->setHasTouch(false);
 * // now fully create
 * seat->create();
 * @endcode
 *
 * To forward input events one needs to set the focused surface, update time stamp and then
 * forward the actual events:
 *
 * @code
 * // example for pointer
 * seat->setFocusedPointerSurface(surface, QPointF(100, 200)); // surface at it's global position
 * seat->setTimestamp(100);
 * seat->notifyPointerMotion(QPointF(350, 210)); // global pos, local pos in surface: 250,10
 * seat->notifyPointerFrame();
 * seat->setTimestamp(110);
 * seat->notifyPointerButton(Qt::LeftButton, PointerButtonState::Pressed);
 * seat->notifyPointerFrame();
 * seat->setTimestamp(120);
 * seat->notifyPointerButton(Qt::LeftButton, PointerButtonState::Released);
 * seat->notifyPointerFrame();
 * @endcode
